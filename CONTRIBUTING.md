# Contributing to Frontend Engineering Lab

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This guide explains how to contribute and the structure every contribution should follow. Following a consistent format keeps the knowledge base high-quality, searchable, and easy to read.

## Types of Contributions

- **Technical articles** — patterns, techniques, deep dives
- **Architecture discussions** — design decisions and their tradeoffs
- **Performance optimization techniques** — with measurements where possible
- **Code examples** — concise, production-oriented snippets
- **Case studies** — real incidents, migrations, refactors, lessons learned
- **Best practices** — with the reasoning behind them
- **Interview preparation resources** — grounded in real engineering
- **Improvements** — fixing typos, clarifying explanations, updating outdated content

## Contribution Principles

- Focus on **practical engineering knowledge**, things you'd tell a teammate
- **Explain tradeoffs**, almost nothing in engineering is absolute
- Keep examples **concise and production-oriented**
- **Avoid promotional content**, no product pitches, affiliate links, or self-promotion
- Write for clarity, assume the reader is smart but unfamiliar with the topic
- **Original content only**, don't copy articles from elsewhere. Linking to references is encouraged

## Article Structure

Articles follow a common structure so the knowledge base stays consistent and easy to read. Use the sections that apply to your article and add any others it needs — only the metadata header is required. Start by copying a template from [`templates/`](templates/):

- [`templates/article-template.md`](templates/article-template.md) — for patterns, techniques, and deep dives
- [`templates/case-study-template.md`](templates/case-study-template.md) — for real-world stories and incidents

### 1. Metadata header (required)

Every article starts with this header:

```markdown
# Title of Your Article

> **Topic:** React · **Level:** Intermediate · **Author:** [@yourhandle](https://github.com/yourhandle)
```

- **Topic** — the section the article belongs to (React, TypeScript, Performance, etc.)
- **Level** — `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced`
- **Author** — your GitHub handle (so you get credit!)

### 2. Recommended sections

Most articles work well with this shape — use what applies:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **The Problem** | What problem does this solve? Why should the reader care? |
| **The Solution / The Pattern** | Your main content, with code examples where relevant |
| **Tradeoffs** | When does this approach shine? When does it hurt? |
| **Key Takeaways** | 3–5 bullet points the reader should remember |

Other sections you can add: **Background/Context**, **Alternatives Considered**, **References**. Whatever sections you choose, try to cover the problem, the approach, and its tradeoffs somewhere in the article.

### 3. Code examples

- Use fenced code blocks with a language tag (` ```tsx `, ` ```ts `, ` ```css `)
- Keep snippets focused, show the relevant part, not the whole app
- Prefer TypeScript for JavaScript examples
- Show **before/after** when demonstrating an improvement

## File Naming & Placement

- Place your article in the most relevant top-level folder (e.g. `react/`, `performance/`)
- Use **kebab-case** file names that describe the content:
  - ✅ `react/error-boundaries-in-practice.md`
  - ✅ `performance/reducing-bundle-size-with-code-splitting.md`
  - ❌ `react/MyArticle.md`, `performance/tips.md`
- One article per file
- Add a link to your article in the folder's `README.md` index

## Proposing a New Top-Level Topic

The existing folders are a starting point, not a limit. If you want to write about an area we haven't declared yet (e.g. `animations/`, `security/`, `build-tooling/`, `developer-experience/`, `css/`), you're welcome to propose it.

To add a new top-level topic:

1. **Open a content proposal issue first** describing the topic and why it deserves its own section. This avoids overlap with existing folders (e.g. a CSS performance article likely belongs in `performance/`, not a new folder)
2. Once agreed, create the folder using a **kebab-case** name (e.g. `build-tooling/`)
3. Add a `README.md` to the folder that follows the same pattern as the existing sections:
   - A one-line description of the topic
   - An **Articles** index section (where contributions get linked)
   - An **Ideas for Contributions** list with a few starter ideas
   - A link back to this guide and the [article template](templates/article-template.md)
4. Add the new section to the **What You'll Find Here** table and the **Repository Structure** tree in the root `README.md`
5. Include your first article in the same PR, a new section should never be empty

Articles inside the new topic follow the same pattern as everywhere else: the required metadata header, plus the recommended sections that apply (The Problem, The Solution, Tradeoffs, Key Takeaways).

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch** with a descriptive name:
   - `add/react-error-boundaries`
   - `fix/typo-in-testing-guide`
3. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:
   - `Add article on error boundaries in React`
4. **Submit a Pull Request** using the PR template
5. A maintainer will review your contribution. Reviews focus on:
   - Accuracy and clarity
   - Following the article structure
   - Practical, non-promotional content

We may suggest edits, this is normal and collaborative, not a rejection. Most PRs are merged after a round of light feedback.

### Proposing an idea first

Not sure if your topic fits? Open a **content proposal issue** before writing. It saves you time and lets the community weigh in.

## Writing Tips

- **Lead with the problem**, not the tool
- Short paragraphs beat walls of text
- Use headings, lists, and tables to make content scannable
- A small, real example beats a long, abstract explanation
- It's okay to say *"it depends"*, just explain what it depends on
- English doesn't need to be perfect. Clarity matters more than grammar, reviewers will help polish
